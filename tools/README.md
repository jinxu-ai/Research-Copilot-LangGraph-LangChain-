# tools/

This directory contains custom tools used by the Research Copilot.

- `web_search.py` — query a search engine API or mock results.
- `read_pdf.py` — load and split PDF files.
- `read_html.py` — fetch and clean HTML text.
- `python_exec.py` — restricted safe Python execution.
- `write_markdown.py` — export notes to Markdown format.

Each tool should be self-contained and safely callable by the graph.
